# Rails 3.2 playground

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hongymagic/glossy-rails.png)](http://travis-ci.org/hongymagic/glossy-rails)

This project was created so I could better understand `Rails 3.2` and `ruby-lang`. Occasional fuck ups _are_ okay.

## Still to learn

1. <del>How model validation works :client, :server, :anything and :everything</del>
2. Request life-cycle :filters, :actions, :redirects
3. Fucking `routes`.
4. Why do every `gem` introduce a new fucking `config` file
5. Introduce some client-side scripts :serve them correctly
6. Write some tests
7. Write some `Selenium` tests
8. Write some `db:seeds`
9. Read more about Rails 3.2 here: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/3_2_release_notes.html

## TODO

In the order I wish to implement:

1. Complete Backbone.js routes and views
2. Convert views/templates to use `Mustache`
3. Re-create server views that work without Backbone.js
4. Styling

## Findings

I expect to expand on these findings below sometime soon. In the meantime, you'll have to put up with vague, abstract points notations.

1. Rails 3.1 + CoffeeScript â€“ I will never understand why
