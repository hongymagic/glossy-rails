# Rails 3.1 playground

This project was created so I could better understand `Rails 3.1` and `ruby-lang`. Occasional fuck ups _are_ okay.

## Still to learn

1. How model validation works :client, :server, :anything and :everything
2. Request life-cycle :filters, :actions, :redirects
3. Fucking `routes`.
4. Why do every `gem` introduce a new fucking `config` file
5. Introduce some client-side scripts :serve them correctly
6. Write some tests
7. Write some `Selenium` tests
8. Write some `db:seeds`
